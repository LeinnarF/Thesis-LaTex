\section{Research Design}

This study primarily focuses on the development and implementation of a mobile application that generates personalized itineraries for tourists. The research design is structured to ensure that the system is developed based on empirical evidence and is evaluated for its quality, standards, and acceptability among users and professionals in the tourism industry. The quantitative aspect of the research design allows for the collection and analysis of numerical data to assess the effectiveness of the system, while the applied research approach ensures that the development of the system is grounded in real-world applications and addresses the specific needs of its intended users.

\subsection{Quantitative Research}
The quantitative research, specifically, descriptive research design is one of the designs in this study. This aspect of the study measure, analyze, and describe the quality, standards, and acceptability of the system using quantitative methods by collecting user and professional feedback. The researchers assess the quality and standards using the ISO/IEC 25010:2023 standard by seeking professionals to assess the system. While the acceptability of the system for tourists was analyzed using the Technology Acceptable Model (TAM). Incorporating quantitative approach for the study ensures an empirical and evidence-based support for the quality and acceptability of the developed system.

\subsection{Applied Research}
The applied research aspect of the study focuses on developing and implementing a system for generating personalized itineraries and optimizing existing itineraries for the interests of the user. The primary objective of this study is to create a mobile application that optimizes itineraries using the best Metaheuristic algorithm and generates personalized itineraries with travel budget using Adaptive Genetic Algorithm with Dynamic Mutation and Crossover Probabilities (AGAM) framework. The selection of the best metaheuristic algorithm was based on the performance of the algorithms in terms of solution quality and runtime efficiency. In this study, AGAM is explicitly adopted for itinerary generation and optimization even though it can also be used for route optimization. This is because the literature showed that AGAM showcased the effectiveness of AGAM for itinerary generation and optimization. The development of the system involves the use of mathematical models such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for route optimization and the Orienteering Problem (OP) for itinerary generation. The implementation of these models in the mobile application ensures that the system is grounded in real-world applications and addresses the specific needs of its intended users, providing a practical solution for personalized itinerary generation and optimization.

\section{Model Adoption}
This section discusses the optimization problems such as route optimization and itinerary generation and the steps in modeling each mathematically. Specifically, the mathematical models used in the study are the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and the orienteering problem (OP).

\subsection{Modeling Route Optimization with TSP}
Route optimization refers to the process of finding the optimal order in visiting a set of places. This is also another definition of the TSP, where the salesman must minimize the travel cost between traveling a set of cities. In the study, the POI represents the nodes and the edges connecting each node as the distance between the shortest route, a sample graph is shown in Figure \ref{tspgraph}. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\caption{Sample Graph}
	\label{tspgraph}
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{TSP.jpeg}
\end{figure}

The objective is to minimize the total travel distance by finding the best order to travel each POI from an itinerary. Using integer programming and given a graph $G$ = $(V, E)$ where \( V \) is the set of vertices (POI) and \( E \) is the set of edges (road distance), the objective function is as shown in Equation \ref{eq:tsp}:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:tsp}
	\text{Minimize } \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \sum_{j = 1, j \neq i} c_{ij} x_{ij}
\end{equation}
Where $n$ is the total number of vertices (POI), $c_{ij}$ refers to the cost of traveling from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$, which in this case is the distance between the two POI, and $x_{ij}$ refers to a binary value that indicates whether an edge directly connecting vertex $i$ to vertex $j$ exists in the solution (1 if it exists, 0 otherwise). The function is also constrained to the following:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Every city is entered and exited exactly once.
	\item The solution does not contain any sub-tours.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Candidate Algorithms for TSP}
The study considers several metaheuristic algorithms for route optimization for Lakad, each with its unique approach and characteristics. These algorithms include:

\begin{enumerate}
	
\item \textbf{Genetic Algorithm (GA).} Inspired by genetics and evolution, the Genetic Algorithm is an optimization technique that works by analyzing potential solutions and generating new ones through the processes of selection, crossover, and mutation. This iterative process continues until a predefined termination requirement is met. GA is widely used across various domains because of its ability to navigate complex search spaces and identify optimal or near-optimal solutions \parencite{Hossain2024}.

\item \textbf{Ant Colony Optimization (ACO).} The Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is an optimization algorithm that mimics the foraging behavior of ants. It utilizes artificial pheromone trails to guide the search for optimal solutions. Ants in the algorithm employ probabilistic pheromones and heuristic information to address problems. The quality of the solutions determines how the pheromone trails are updated. This mechanism encourages exploration and prevents premature convergence. ACO has proven effective for various optimization difficulties \parencite{Hossain2024}.

\item \textbf{Simulated Annealing (SA).} The Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm is a metaheuristic technique influenced by the annealing process in metallurgy. It begins with an initial solution and incorporates a mechanism that allows for the occasional acceptance of a "worse" solution based on and more thoroughly explore the solution space. The probability of accepting a worse solution is gradually reduced over time, simulating the cooling process. SA is applicable to a wide range of optimization problems \parencite{Hossain2024}.

\item \textbf{Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).} The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is inspired by the social behavior of bird flocks and fish schools. In PSO, the population is made up of numerous particles, each representing a potential solution within the search space. Every particle is characterized by a velocity and a fitness value. Conceptually, PSO is very straightforward, as it relies solely on elementary mathematical operations and does not require any derived information about the optimization function \parencite{Wadi2025}.

\item \textbf{Elephant Herding Optimization (EHO).} The Elephant Herding Optimization (EHO) algorithm is a swarm-based metaheuristic search approach for addressing optimization problems that mimics the real herding behavior of elephants, which involves organizing elephant swarms into smaller clans, each led by a matriarch and consisting of multiple female elephants and their calves, while adult male calves are expelled from the clan \parencite{Wadi2025}.

\item \textbf{Gray Wolf Optimizer (GWO).} The Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm is a metaheuristic technique inspired by gray wolves, simulating their leadership and cooperative hunting behaviors to locate optimal solutions. The hierarchical structure of a wolf pack (Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omega wolves) is shown in the algorithm's design. Wolves' positions are updated based on the Alpha's location and the calculated hunting distance. GWO leverages a balance of exploration and exploitation to discover the best possible solutions. This approach has been successfully applied to various optimization challenges \parencite{Hossain2024}. 

\item \textbf{Hovering Scouts and Foraging Flocks Pied Kingfisher Optimizer (HSFFPKO).} HSFFPKO enhances the traditional Pied Kingfisher Optimizer by introducing multiscale search mechanisms to improve optimization performance. By adding Hovering Scouts for fine-grained local adjustments and Foraging Flocks for parallel group-based exploitation, the algorithm maintains better population diversity than its predecessor. These additions allow HSFFPKO to mitigate local optima entrapment and solve complex, high-dimensional problems more efficiently \parencite{DelaCruz2025HSFFPKO}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{TSP Algorithm Selection}

To determine the best algorithm to implement for Lakad, a comparative analysis was conducted on several metaheuristic algorithms used for solving TSP. The analysis focuses on solution quality (accuracy) and runtime speed of each algorithm. The algorithms were tested on selected instances from the TSPLIB library, a standard benchmark for TSP and related problems. Table \ref{tsplib_instace} presents selected instances for benchmarking. 

\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\singlespacing
	\caption{TSPLIB Instances for Benchmarking}
	\label{tsplib_instace} \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}
	\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{XXX}
		\toprule
		\textbf{TSPLIB instance} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Optimal Solution} \\
		\midrule
		burma14 & Small instance with 14 cities & 3323\\ 
		bays29 & Medium instance with 29 cities & 2020\\ 
		eil51 & Large instance with 51 cities & 426\\ 
		berlin52 & Large instance with 52 cities & 7542\\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\textbf{Experimental Setup.} The experiments were implemented in Python because of its library support for TSPLIB, and for simplicity of the language. To ensure statistical reliability and mitigate the stochastic nature of heuristic algorithms, each algorithm was executed for 10 independent iterations on each TSPLIB instance. This was based on studies of \textcite{Hossain2024,Wadi2025}, where repeated independent runs are used to account for the stochastic nature of metaheuristics algorithms, as a single run may be differed from other runs.

The results were averaged to get the baseline performance profile. 
Two primary metrics were defined to evaluate the algorithms:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Runtime Speed (\( T_{avg} \)).} It measures the average time it takes to find the solution across the 10 iterations, measured in seconds. This metric is crucial for assessing the efficiency of the algorithm, and is calculated using the formula shown in equation \ref{eq:runtime}: 
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:runtime}
		T_{avg} = \frac{1}{10} \sum_{i=1}^{10} T_i
	\end{equation}
	Where $T _{i}$ is the runtime for the $i$-th iteration.

	\item \textbf{Solution Quality (\( Q_{avg} \)).} Since the best solution for each TSPLIB instance is known, the accuracy is measured by the average relative error of the solution found by the algorithm compared to the optimal solution. The calculation is shown in equation \ref{eq:quality}:
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:quality}
		Q_{avg} = \frac{1}{10} \sum_{i=1}^{10} \frac{C_i - C_{opt}}{C_{opt}} \times 100
	\end{equation}
	Where $C_i$ is the cost of the solution found in the $i$-th iteration, and $C_{opt}$ is the cost of the known optimal solution for the instance. This metric provides insight into how close the algorithm's solutions are to the optimal solution, with lower values indicating better performance.
\end{enumerate}

Furthermore, each algorithm was executed on the same hardware and software environment to ensure a fair comparison. The experiments were conducted on a machine with a Ryzen 5 3400G processor, 16GB of RAM, and running Arch Linux. The algorithms were implemented with Jupyter Notebook, and the runtime was measured using Python's built-in `time` module.

\textbf{Algorithm Ranking.} To select the final algorithm, the trade-off between speed and accuracy was resolved using Simple Additive Weighting (SAW).SAW was chosen because of its simplicity and interpretability, allowing for a straightforward comparison of the algorithms based on the defined metrics. Since both $T _{avg}$ and $Q_{avg}$ are “cost” criteria, i.e., lower values represent better performance, it is normalized relative to the maximum (worst) observed value to scale all metrics between 0 and 1. The normalization formula used was shown in equation \ref{eq:norm}:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:norm}
	r _{ij} = \frac{x_{ij}}{\max(x_{ij})}
\end{equation}
Where $r _{ij}$ is the normalized value of the $j$-th criteria for the $i$-th algorithm, $x_{ij}$ is the original value of the $j$-th criteria for the $i$-th algorithm, and $\max(x_{ij})$ is the maximum value observed for the $j$-th criteria across all algorithms. This normalization ensures that both metrics are on a comparable scale, allowing for a fair assessment of each algorithm's performance in terms of both speed and accuracy. 

The final score $S _{i}$ for each algorithm $i$ was calculated in equation \ref{eq:saw}: 
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:saw}
	S _{i} = \sum_{j=1}^{n} w_j \cdot r _{ij}
\end{equation}
Where $S _{i}$ is the final score for the $i$-th algorithm, $w_j$ is the weight assigned to the $j$-th criteria, such that $\sum_{j=1}^{n} w_j = 1$, and $r _{ij}$ is the normalized value of the $j$-th criteria for the $i$-th algorithm. Additionally, the 

For this study, since the weights can be subjectively assigned, equal weights were assigned to both criteria, i.e., $w _{1} = w _{2} = 0.5$. This gives equal importance of runtime speed and solution quality, the final score is shown in equation \ref{eq:finalscore}:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:finalscore}
	S _{i} = 0.5 \cdot r _{i1} + 0.5 \cdot r _{i2}
\end{equation}

The algorithm with the lowest score $S _{i}$ is considered the best choice for implementation for Lakad. The results of the algorithm selection process are discussed in Chapter 4. 

\subsection{Modeling Itinerary Generation as Orienteering Problem}

Another core optimization problem in the study is itinerary generation, which can be modeled as an orienteering problem (OP). In the context of the study, an itinerary refers to a plan of the user to go to two or more places. An itinerary can be modeled mathematically using graph theory similar to TSP. This would involve setting the vertices of a graph as the places and the edges as the road distance between the connected edges. A big difference of OP from TSP is the fact that it takes the whole graph or all the possible POI and outputs a subgraph instead, where TSP would use the entire graph given. An example is shown in Figure \ref{opgraph} where 5 POI are given as input and only three were used to generate an itinerary.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\caption{Subgraph result from OP}
	\label{opgraph}
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{subgraph.png}
\end{figure}

The objective of the OP is to maximize the available profit, in the case of the study: travel distance, to generate an itinerary for the user alongside other factors. Mathematically, the OP can be formulated as follows in Equation \ref{eq:op}.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:op}
	\text{Maximize } Z = \sum_{i = 2}^{n - 1} \sum_{j = 2}^{n}S _{i} x _{ij}  
\end{equation}
Where $n$ is the total number of vertices (POI), $S _{i}$ is the score of vertex $i$, which can be a combination of factors such as travel distance, user preferability score, and popularity rating, $x _{ij}$ is a binary variable that indicates whether the edge from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$ is included in the itinerary (1 if included, 0 otherwise), and $Z$ is the total score of the itinerary, which the algorithm aims to maximize. The function is also constrained to the following:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Each vertex must only be visited once.
	\item The total score must not exceed the given budget.
	\item The generated path must be connected.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Adaptive Genetic Algorithm with Dynamic Mutation and Crossover Probabilities}

The study also chose to adopt a modified variant of the genetic algorithm developed by \textcite{Yochum2020} called Adaptive Genetic Algorithm with Dynamic Mutation and Crossover Probabilities (AGAM) for the optimization of recommended itineraries defined in terms of TSP. AGAM addresses itinerary planning as a Multi-Objective Optimization Problem, an optimization technique rooting from orienteering problems. As discussed in their work, \textcite{Yochum2020} developed AGAM to generate optimal and personalized travel itineraries by balancing several objectives such as point of interest (POI) rating, and distance of POIs between the next one. Rooting from Genetic Algorithm (GA), AGAM simulates the process of natural evolution and utilizes genetic operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation to iteratively improve the quality of itineraries which, unlike traditional GA that use fixed mutation rates, also employs dynamic adjustments in parameters during the evolutionary process in a way that can maintain population diversity and therefore generate efficient and adaptive solutions. Even though AGAM can also be used for route optimization, the study chose to use it for itinerary generation because of its effectiveness in generating personalized itineraries as shown in the study of \textcite{Yochum2020}.

In this implementation, the population set is defined as $P = \left\{ p _{1},\dots, p _{n} \right\}$, where each individual $p _{i}$ represents a potential itinerary. An itinerary is encoded as a sequence of POIs, $p _{i}= \left\{ q _{1}, q _{2}, \dots, q _{m} \right\}$, where each gene $q _{i}$ corresponds to a specific POI visit. The length of the sequence depends on the number of POIs selected, and it is constrained by a user-defined limit $MAXN$. The total travel distance of the itinerary is constrained by $MAXD$, which ensures that the generated itineraries does not exceed the user's travel distance budget. 

\textbf{Fitness Function.} The quality of each itinerary is evaluated by the fitness function given in Equation \ref{agamFitness}. Since factors such as popularity, rating, and interest are on different scales, a normalization process is applied to each factor so that its values is between 0 and 1. 

\begin{equation}
	\label{agamFitness}
	f(p_i) = w_{1}Ti(p_i) + w_{2}Tn(p_i) + w_{3}Tr(p_i) 
\end{equation}
Where $w _{j}$ for $j = 1, 2, 3$, represents the weight assigned to each factor, and it is defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    
    \item $Ti(p_i)$ is the sum of all interest values of each POI in the itinerary $p_i$. Each POI contains an interest value which quantifies how interested the user is in that specific POI category. The formula for calculating $Ti(p_i)$ is shown in Equation \ref{Ti},
    \begin{equation}
		\label{Ti}
		Ti ( p _{i} ) = \sum _{q_i \in p_i} I(q_i)
	\end{equation}
	where $I(q_i)$ is a binary value that indicates whether the user is interested in the category of POI $q_i$ (1 if interested, 0 otherwise).
    
    \item $Tn (p _{i})$ is the total number of POIs in $p _{i}$, which is calculated in Equation \ref{Tn}.
    \begin{equation}
        \label{Tn}
        Tn ( p _{i}) = \frac{N _{op} ( p _{i} )}{NOP}, \quad \text{where } N _{op} ( p _{i} ) \le MAXN 
    \end{equation}
    where $N _{op} ( p _{i} )$ is the number of POIs in itinerary $p _{i}$, and $NOP$ is the total number of available POIs.
    
    \item $Tr( p _{i} )$ is the total rating of $p_i$ given by Equation \ref{Tr},
    \begin{equation}
        \label{Tr}
        Tr ( p _{i} ) = \frac{\sum_{q_i \in p_i} R(q_i)}{MAXR}
    \end{equation} 
    where $R(q_i)$ is the rating of a specific POI $q_i$ in itinerary $p_i$ obtained from Google Maps, and $MAXR$ is the best possible rating of all POIs defined as $MAXR = \text{Number of POIs} * \text{Maximum Rating}$.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Adaptive Genetic Operators.} AGAM incorporates dynamic adjustments in mutation and crossover probabilities to balance exploration (searching new solutions) and exploitation (refining existing solutions). These are defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Adaptive Crossover $ ( P _{c} )$.} To preserve high-quality solutions, the crossover probability decreases as the fitness of the parents exceeds the population average $ ( f _{avg} )$. This is given by Equation \ref{crossover},
    \begin{equation}
        \label{crossover}
        PC = \begin{cases}
            pc_1 - \dfrac{(pc_1 - pc_2)(f' - f_{avg})}{f_{max} - f_{avg}}, & f' \ge f_{avg} \\
            pc_1, & f' < f_{avg}
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
    Here, $pc_1$ and $pc_2$ are the upper and lower bounds for crossover probability,$f_{max}$ is the largest valued fitness score among the set of populations $P$, $f'$ is the larger fitness score of the two parents being crossed, and $f_{avg}$ refers to the average fitness score of the population $P$. 

    \item \textbf{Adaptive Mutation $ ( P _{m} )$.} Similarly, mutation rates are adjusted to prevent destroying optimal solutions. This is defined in Equation \ref{mutation},
    \begin{equation}
        \label{mutation}
        PM = \begin{cases}
            pm_1 - \dfrac{(pm_1 - pm_2)(f - f_{avg})}{f_{max} - f_{avg}}, & f \ge f_{avg} \\
            pm_1, & f < f_{avg}
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
    where $pm_1$ and $pm_2$  are the bounds for mutation probability, and $f$ is the fitness score of the individual being mutated.
\end{itemize}

For the parameters of AGAM, the following values were used: $pc_1 = 0.9$, $pc_2 = 0.6$, $pm_1 = 0.1$, and $pm_2 = 0.01$. These values were chosen based on \textcite{Yochum2020} recommendation, which are commonly used in dynamic crossover and mutation probabilities. The procedure of AGAM is shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:agam}.

\section{Process of Developing the System}

The development of the Lakad mobile application uses the AGILE methodology, with a specific focus on the Kanban method. This approach integrates all key software development phases. These phase include analysis, planning, design, development, testing, and review, each of the phases contributes to the overall quality and functionality of the final product.

Kanban is a highly effective visual process management system designed to optimize the flow of work. It operates on the principle of Just In Time (JIT) delivery, as highlighted by \textcite{Alaidaros2021}, ensuring the tasks are completed and delivered precisely when needed to maximize efficiency. 

This methodology offers significant advantages for the Lakad development team. It provides a clear, visual representation of the entire workflow, allowing all team members to easily track progress from start to finish. This transparency is crucial for quickly identifying potential bottlenecks, gaps in the process, or any mishaps that might arise. By making the workflow visible, the team can proactively address issues, rather than reacting to them after they have escalated. Kanban, being a type of Agile-based methodology, is an approach that promotes flexibility which can help in an environment of software development where problems and unforeseen challenges are inevitable. Kanban's adaptability allows the team to adjust priorities and reallocate resources as needed, ensuring that progress remains steady even when obstacles are encountered. This flexibility is key to maintaining momentum and delivering a high-quality software output \parencite{Risener2022}. The continuous flow and iterative nature of Kanban supports the team in delivering a robust and reliable system that meets user needs effectively. Figure \ref{kanban} shows a graphical representation of a Kanban workflow model.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Analysis}
The analysis phase of the development involves outlining the system’s scope, objectives, and requirements. This was done by reviewing the existing literature in itinerary recommendation and local tourism in the province of Bulacan. This phase establishes the key features of Lakad, that integrates five major features designed to provide optimized, personalized, and efficient itinerary planning for tourists exploring Bulacan. Each feature combines techniques, verified local data, and user-centric design principles.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Tourist Spot Exploration.}
		A tourist spot search feature allows the users to explore Bulacan’s tourist attractions specifically through an interface where they can search through a catalog of  tourist destinations that was verified by the Provincial History, Arts, Culture, and Tourism Office (PHACTO) of Bulacan. Furthermore, the system displays important and relevant information such as location and short description about the tourist spot.

	\item \textbf{Personalized Itinerary Generation.}
		The main feature of Lakad is the personalized itinerary generator focusing on the diverse cultural, historical and heritage tourist destinations located across the province of Bulacan. The system developed to adapt to user-specific factors that can affect the personalization aspect of an itinerary. This feature aims to cater the personal preferences that a user has while still promoting the exploration of the rich tourism culture of the region.

	\item \textbf{Itinerary Optimization.}
		The optimization feature of the system works in line with the personalized itinerary generator by employing the chosen best algorithm for route optimization. The optimization further helps the minimization of travel distance and constraints to visit every possible destination within the generated itinerary.

	\item \textbf{Itinerary Management.}
		An Itinerary Management feature of the application allows users to manage and organize their itineraries. The users may add, edit, or remove destinations from their itinerary. It also allows the tracking of visited and unvisited locations so that users are informed of the status of their progress in the itinerary. Users are also able to save and reload itineraries for future use.

	\item \textbf{Itinerary Navigation.}
		This feature assist the user during travel by providing real-time navigation support. Users are able to track their current location and visualize routes similar to Google Maps. It displays direction, travel duration, and distances between tourist spots and supports live GPS tracking to help users follow their itinerary accurately.

\end{enumerate}
Furthermore, the application includes a user profile feature that allows users to create and manage their profiles, which can store their preferences, past itineraries, and other relevant information. This feature enhances the personalization aspect of the system by allowing it to learn from user behavior and preferences over time.

In addition, the data gathering process was also conducted in this phase, which involved collecting data on tourist destinations in Bulacan given by PHACTO. This data was used to populate the system with verified and relevant information about the tourist spots in the province, which is crucial for the functionality of the search and itinerary generation features.

\subsection{Planning}
The Gantt chart provides a visual timeline of the schedule of the research activity that was conducted in the process of developing Lakad. It outlines the sequence of tasks relating to Thesis I and Thesis II, including the flow of each phase of the research from documentation and planning until system development, evaluation, and final defense.

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

The \textbf{Thesis I} output focuses on the research documentation and planning for development of Lakad. This process begins with the Review of Related Studies (Chapter 2), in which local and foreign studies are gathered, evaluated, and organized to develop the theoretical and conceptual framework. By gathering information in Chapter 2, determining the best algorithm for the system, and the appropriate approach to execute the idea, the researchers were able to establish a solid foundation that would be the basis of the succeeding phases. After completing Chapter 1: Problem and its Background and Chapter 2, the researchers finalize the concepts, models, and methods that was utilized in Chapter 3: Methodology preparation. Chapter 3 defines the research design, the selected development model, and the desired process on creating the system, as well as the foundation on system evaluation and data gathering that was conducted on Thesis II.

For \textbf{Thesis II}, the researcher proceeds to the implementation and completion phase. The group developed and implemented the proposed system based on the design created in Thesis I. 

\textbf{System Development and Implementation}. This phase focuses on building and integrating the components of the system based on the planned design. In the development process, the construction of the front-end, database integration, and feature implementation following the chosen development model. Testing and debugging processes was carried out on a regular basis to ensure proper functionality and performance.

\textbf{System Testing and Evaluation}. This phase is for testing the reliability, usability, and general quality of the system. Various testing procedures was conducted to ensure that every function works as planned and meets user needs. Feedback was collected from users and a system analyst to identify areas that need improvement.

\textbf{Data Analysis and Interpretation}. This stage includes data processing and data analysis that are conducted from the system evaluation. Responses collected was organized, encoded, and statistically analyzed to determine user perceptions as well as the general performance of the system.

\subsection{Design}
The design phase focuses on creating the overall architecture and structure of the system. This includes defining the system components, their interactions, and the data flow within the application. The system architecture was designed to ensure scalability, maintainability, and efficiency. The researchers created diagrams and models to visualize the system’s structure and functionality.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\caption{System Architecture}
	\label{SysArch}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{SysArch.png}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{SysArch} illustrates the system architecture of Lakad: A Personalized Mobile Itinerary Creator and how the different components of the application interact to provide personalized and optimized travel itineraries for users. At the core of the system is the mobile frontend, which serves as the main interface where tourists can search for tourist destinations, generate itineraries, and manage their travel plans. When a user interacts with the application, the frontend communicates with the Mapbox API to send requests for map data, location coordinates The API processes these requests and returns the corresponding responses, which are then displayed on the user interface in the form of maps and travel routes. In addition, the application stores user-generated itineraries and relevant information in a remote database using Supabase, allowing users to access and manage their itineraries. While admin users have access to admin gui separate from tourists where they can manage the places shown to the users as well as recalculate the distance matrix via the OpenRouteService matrix api.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\caption{Entity Relationship Diagram}
	\label{erd}
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{erd.jpeg}
\end{figure}

The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the system, as shown in Figure \ref{erd}, consists of eight entities; \texttt{place}, \texttt{opening\_hours}, \texttt{distances}, \texttt{stops}, \texttt{itinerary}, \texttt{profiles}, \texttt{reviews}, and \texttt{review\_reports}. A \texttt{profiles} entity can generate many itineraries of the entity \texttt{itinerary} and provide multiple entries in the \texttt{reviews} entity. An \texttt{itinerary} entity can contain as many stops, and acts as a junction entity for a place before being organized inside an itinerary, which lets the system properly assign a \texttt{visit\_order} and \texttt{visit\_duration} for a location within a specific trip. \texttt{stops} entities reference a place, which serves as the central container for location data, coordinates, and ratings. Additionally, each place has at least one dedicated \texttt{opening\_hours} entry to define its schedule. A place entity can be the subject of multiple reviews. A \texttt{reviews} entity may also have its own \texttt{review\_reports} which are then used by the system to track moderation status.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\caption{Data Flow Diagram}
	\label{dfd}
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{DFD.png}
\end{figure}

Two types of users exist for the whole system which is the tourist and admins as illustrated in Figure \ref{dfd}. There are two main flows for the tourist actions: place flow and itinerary flow. The  tourists can view and add places to their itineraries. They can also perform create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on their itineraries. One part of the itinerary flow starts from the user generating an itinerary through the AGAM process is sent to the itinerary management process for the visualization through graphical user interface and is saved to the database. Tourists can also optimize the stops in the itineraries and request navigation instructions for the itinerary. Admins on the other hand, manages what the users can see. They can perform CRUD operations on the places that are seen by the tourists.

\subsection{Development}

This development phase pertains to the actual coding and implementation of the system’s features inside an android application. The researchers’ utilized the AGILE methodology, particularly the Kanban method for the software development life cycle. This includes weekly meetings and development checks by the researchers to ensure the system is properly developed to its intended uses. Lakad was developed using the React Native main development framework, which uses fast and cost-efficient cross-platform mobile development, allowing a single codebase to function on both iOS and Android devices. The system utilized the JavaScript programming language for implementing the application’s user interface and core functionalities due to its flexibility and compatibility with React Native framework. The main development environment for writing, editing, and debugging the program was Visual Studio Code, which provided lightweight performance and had a large selection of extensions appropriate for React Native development. Throughout the development process, Git and GitHub was used to ensure structured collaboration and version control. The list of tools used in the development is presented in Table \ref{listtools}.

Additionally, React Native extends the "Learn once, write anywhere" paradigm to mobile development, leveraging recent advancements like its new architecture and the JavaScript Interface (JSI). The framework's structure, represented by Fabric, aims to boost compatibility with modern React features such as concurrent rendering and synchronous data fetching. While JSI’s main element allows for direct calls between JavaScript and native code. This change features a smoother interaction with the host platform and significantly reduces performance bottlenecks. JSI also allows Fabric to create UI components on the native side more efficiently. The combined adoption of JSI and Fabric offers a significant enhancement in React Native's performance, making it a good choice for developers who desire the agility of mobile development and native platform functionalities \parencite{Zhou2024}.

This framework allows the researchers to develop the mobile application, Lakad, as React Native’s cross-platform capabilities also allow for android development.

	\end{tabularx}
\end{table}


\subsection{Testing}
For the testing phase, Lakad undergo rigorous evaluation to ensure the overall functionality and quality. The process includes system integration and user acceptance testing. System testing focuses on validating each module of the system by using test cases that evaluates the logic of the system which identifies and resolve issues affecting itinerary generation and recommendation features. Integration testing was conducted to ensure that all components of the system, such as itinerary generation and optimization, management, and user interface, operates cohesively to provide a seamless user experience.

\subsection{Review}
The review phase focuses on evaluating the overall functionality and usability of the system after development is completed. The researchers gather views and opinions of users, including a system analyst to determine whether the system runs efficiently and serves its desired purposes. Guided by their observation, necessary adjustments and enhancements done to refine the system.


\section{System Evaluation}
This section outlines the methods and criteria used to evaluate Lakad, the developed mobile itinerary generator system. It details the instruments and standards for assessment, describes the target population and sampling approach, and explains the procedures for data collection and analysis. The goal is to ensure that the system meets user needs and quality benchmarks through structured evaluation using both user and expert feedback.

\subsection{Evaluation Instrument}
The evaluation instrument for the developed system uses Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) for the end-users and ISO / IEC 25010:2023 for IT professionals. This combination of evaluation methods allows for a comprehensive assessment of the system from both user experience and technical quality perspectives. 

\textbf{Technology Acceptance Model (TAM).} The developed system was evaluated using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), as it provides a theoretical framework for understanding the process by which users accept and adopt new technologies. TAM is widely applied in system development studies for calculating the level of user acceptance based on their perceptions and intentions for using a system. To evaluate the effectiveness and acceptance of the proposed system, the following key constructs was evaluated:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Perceived Usefulness}. This construct measures how much users would believe that system usage would improve their task performance. It looks at whether system functionalities like itinerary recommendation, generation, and optimal route provide concrete value and efficiency to the user.
	\item \textbf{Perceived Ease Of Use}. This measures the degree of which users find the system easy to learn and operate. It singles out features including interface design, feature clarity, and the convenience of performing tasks.
	\item \textbf{Attitude Toward Using}. This assesses the sentiment, satisfaction, and positive impression towards using the system. It measures how much the user enjoys interaction with the system and whether they find it useful and interesting.
	\item \textbf{Behavioral Intention To Use}. This criterion measures the tendency and likelihood of the user to continue using the system in the future. It measures the intentions of the people to recommend or repeatedly use the system as their preferred tool.
\end{enumerate}

The TAM questionnaire in this study was an adapted version of a TAM questionnaire, which was modified to fit the context of Lakad. A demographic section is also included in the questionnaire to assess the respondent's experience in mobile application, and travelling frequency.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Experience in Mobile Applications}. This demographic assesses how knowledgeable the respondent is in terms of mobile application usage, which is defined by how much they use mobile applications.
	\item \textbf{Travelling Frequency}. This demographic assesses how much time does a respondent spend away from their home, which is defined by how often they go out in a week or month.
\end{enumerate}

Additionally, a reliability test was conducted on the TAM questionnaire to ensure that the instrument is consistent and reliable for measuring user acceptance. The reliability test was performed using Cronbach's alpha, which assesses the internal consistency of the questionnaire items. A Cronbach's alpha value of 0.7 or higher is generally considered acceptable, indicating that the items in the questionnaire are measuring the same underlying construct effectively \parencite{Cronbach2025}.

\textbf{ISO/IEC 25010:2023.} The developed system was also evaluated by IT professionals using the ISO/IEC 25010:2023 questionnaire which evaluates the overall quality of Lakad. The following criteria was used in the questionnaire and are based on the ISO/IEC 25010:2023 standards:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Functional Suitability}. This focused on how well the proposed system meets the user's needs. The questions were about the system's main features such as itinerary optimization, personalized itinerary generation, and itinerary management.
	\item \textbf{Performance Efficiency}. This assessed the system's ability to provide fast and efficient processing and its capability to handle large amounts of tasks. The questions assessed the system's response time when it comes to itinerary optimization and generation as well as managing the itineraries of the user.
	\item \textbf{Compatibility}. This evaluated the system's compatibility with other external systems that the users might use. The questionnaire verified how well the developed system integrates and works alongside other mapping applications and systems.
	\item \textbf{Interaction Capability}. This focused on the system's usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction. Through this, the system was assessed on how easy the system is to navigate, how intuitive and simple the user interface is for itinerary planning, and how effectively it guides the users.
	\item \textbf{Reliability}. This assessed the system's dependability and consistency in performing its intended functions. The criterion assessed how well the system can operate without failure, maintain stability, and recover from unexpected errors or interruptions.
	\item \textbf{Security}.  This criterion ensured that all collected data remains confidential, secure, and protected. Access to the data will only be available to the researchers and authorized users. No information will be shared with third parties without proper consent.
	\item \textbf{Maintainability}. This assessed the ability of the system to be updated, debugged, and improved. This criterion focused on the ability of the system to adapt to changes and its efficiency during system updates. It ensured that new features or fixes can be integrated without disrupting existing functionalities of the system.
	\item \textbf{Flexibility}. This evaluated the system's ability to adapt to changing user needs, technological changes, and requirement changes. The criterion assessed how easily the system can support new itinerary features, and integrate additional modules or tools.
	\item \textbf{Safety}. This focused on ensuring that the system does not cause any harm to its users. The criterion assessed how well the system protects users from potential risks, errors, or negative consequences that may arise from using the system.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Population and Sample}

The respondents of this study consist of the end-users or the tourists in Bulacan and IT professionals for evaluating Lakad. The tourists are the primary users  of the application, while the IT professionals are the secondary users who evaluates the technical aspects of the system. 

\textbf{End-Users.} The End-users or the tourists are the primary users of the application. The acceptance of the application, measured by TAM, were evaluated by the end-users. 

A multi-stage non-probability sampling technique was used to select the respondents for the end-users. First, municipalities in Bulacan were classified based on their 2025 tourist arrivals (low, medium, high), see Table \ref{tourist_arrivals}. These classifications were based on the data provided by PHACTO, such that < 100,000 arrivals is classified as low, 100,000 to 500,000 arrivals is classified as medium, and > 500,000 arrivals is classified as high. Selected municipalities were chosen from different tourist arrival classifications to ensure a diverse representation of tourists. This approach helps to reduce sampling bias and ensures that the sample reflects the diversity of tourists visiting different areas of Bulacan.

	\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

The selected municipalities for the study were Baliwag, Bocaue, Bustos, Calumpit, Guiguinto, Malolos, Marilao, Plaridel, Pulilan, and San Rafael. These municipalities were chosen to represent a range of tourist arrival classifications (low, medium, high) to ensure that the sample of end-users reflects the diversity of tourists visiting different areas of Bulacan. Within these selected municipalities, respondents were allocated proportionately based on the tourist arrivals of each municipality. This proportional allocation ensures that the sample size from each municipality is representative of the actual distribution of tourists across the region. 

A total sample size of 150 end-users was determined to be appropriate for the study. While standard probability sampling formulas for a population of $N = 8,023,618$ would typically suggest a sample of approximately 400 respondents to achieve a 5\% margin of error. However, the researchers also consider the practical logistical constraints in conducting face-to-face tourist data collection. Hence, a more manageable target of 150 respondents was established, which accepts an approximate margin of error of 8\% at a 95\% confidence level.

		\midrule
		Baliwag		& 1.08 		& 2 	\\
		Bocaue 		& 33.86 	& 51 	\\
		Bustos 		& 7.50 		& 11 	\\

		\midrule
		\textbf{Total} & 100.00 & 150 \\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

Table \ref{endusers} shows the allocation of respondents for end-users based on the proportion of tourist arrivals in each selected municipality. This ensures that the 150 respondents accurately reflect the true geographical distribution of tourist arrivals across the selected municipalities significantly reduces sampling bias and prioritizing a highly representative sample. 

Furthermore, this sample size is justified for evaluating the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). According to \textcite{Memon2020}, a sample sizes of 30 to 500 are appropriate for most behavioral studies based on Roscoe's (1975) guidelines, which TAM falls under. Hence, a sample size of 150 is well within the recommended range for TAM studies. This aligns with methodological recommendations emphasizing that survey sample sizes should be driven by the specific analytical approach and research objectives rather than rigid population proportions \parencite{Memon2020}. It is also consistent with recent regional tourism technology research by \textcite{Raynera2025}, which successfully validated TAM constructs using 80 respondents, further indicating that 150 is more than adequate for achieving reliable results.
	
\textbf{IT Professionals.} IT professionals evaluates the quality of Lakad using the ISO/IEC 25010:2023. A total of 22 IT experts were chosen based on their qualification and relevant experiences. This includes but not limited to computer programmers, UI/UX, and selected faculty members from The College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) at Bulacan State University (BulSU). Additionally, they also provide qualitative feedback on the system’s strengths and areas for improvement.

\subsection{Data Collection}

The data collection process of this study was divided into two parts: one for the end-users (tourists) and another for the IT professionals. Each group was evaluated using different instruments to gather relevant data for assessing the system from both user experience and technical quality perspectives. The end-users were evaluated using TAM, while the IT professionals were evaluated using ISO/IEC 25010:2023. 

Both instruments utilized Likert scales to measure the responses of the respondents. The TAM questionnaire for end-users and the ISO/IEC 25010:2023 evaluation for IT professionals uses 5-point Likert scale. These scales were adopted from existing instruments and were modified to fit the context of this study especially for the TAM questionnaire. The use of Likert scales allows for quantifying the perceptions and evaluations of the respondents, providing a structured way to analyze the data collected from both groups.

\textbf{Preparation and Pilot Testing.} Before the actual data collection, a formal permission was requested and obtained from the local government units (LGUs) of the selected municipalities to conduct the survey among tourists. After obtaining the necessary permissions, pilot testing was conducted to ensure the reliability and validity of the TAM questionnaire. The pilot test was done with a small group of respondents who were similar to the target population. A total of 20 respondents from the municipality of Pandi were selected for the pilot test because it is excluded from the main data collection to avoid bias. The Cronbach alpha of the pilot test results was calculated to make sure that the TAM questionnaire is reliable. The calculated Cronbach's alpha result yielded a value of 0.881 which is above the acceptable threshold of 0.7, indicating that the TAM questionnaire has good internal consistency and is reliable for measuring user acceptance. For the ISO/IEC 25010:2023, since it is a standardized evaluation method, a pilot test was not conducted for this instrument. 

\textbf{Administration to End-users.} The data collection for end-users was conducted through face-to-face surveys in various tourist spots across the selected municipalities in Bulacan. The researchers approached tourists along with the informed consent and invited them to participate in the survey, which included a brief introduction to the Lakad application and its features. After exploring the application, the respondents were asked to complete the TAM questionnaire, which assessed their perceptions of the system's usefulness, ease of use, attitude towards using it, and behavioral intention to use it in the future. Additionally, demographic information such as age bracket, travelling frequency, and technological proficiency was collected to analyze potential correlations between these factors and the TAM constructs.  

\textbf{Administration to IT Professionals.} Permissions to conduct the survey among IT professionals was requested and obtained from the Information and Communications Technology Office (ICTO) of BulSU and to the dean of CICT. The data collection for IT professionals was conducted through an online survey or in-person sessions, depending on the availability and preference of the respondents. The IT professionals were provided with access to the Lakad application and were given a brief overview of its features and functionalities. After exploring the application, they were asked to complete the ISO/IEC 25010:2023 evaluation, which assessed the system's functional suitability, performance efficiency, compatibility, interaction capability, reliability, security, maintainability, flexibility, and safety. In addition to the quantitative evaluation, IT professionals were also encouraged to provide qualitative feedback on the system's strengths and areas for improvement based on their technical expertise.  

\subsection{Data Processing and Analysis}
The researchers conducted systematic data processing and analysis of data from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire and ISO/IEC 25010:2023 system quality evaluation instrument to evaluate user acceptance rates and the total system quality of the Lakad application.

The TAM questionnaire utilized a five-point Likert-type scale to measure respondents’ perception towards Lakad. The response categories were coded numerically as follows: 1 (Strongly disagree); 2 (Disagree); 3 (Neutral); 4 (Agree); and 5 (Strongly agree). The instrument consists of declarative statements that is designed to measure the four TAM constructs (Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, Attitude Towards Using, and Behavioral Intention to Use).

The ISO/IEC 25010:2023 evaluation instrument used a five-point performance rating scale to evaluate system quality constructs through expert assessment. The scale was coded as: 1 (Poor); 2 (Fair); 3 (Good); 4 (Very  good); and 5 (Excellent). The experts used this instrument to assess system quality attributes which included Functional Suitability Performance Efficiency Compatibility Reliability Security Maintainability Flexibility and Safety.

Since responses to individual questionnaire items are ordinal in nature, descriptive statistics were utilized to summarize the data without assuming equal intervals between response categories. At the item level, frequency distributions and median values were computed to describe response patterns and determine the central tendency of each item.

To obtain construct-level measures, composite scores were computed by averaging responses across items corresponding to each construct. For both TAM and ISO/IEC 25010:2023 instruments, the composite score for the $i$-th respondent was calculated using in Equation \ref{Xi},

\begin{equation}
	\label{Xi}
	X_i = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{n} Y_{ij}}{n}
\end{equation}

Where, $X_{i}$ is the composite score for the $i$-th respondent, $Y_{ij}$ is the rating of the $i$-th respondent on the $j$-evaluation item, and $n$ is the total number of item to evaluated for a given construct. 

Although individual items were ordinal, aggregating multiple items to a composite score allows the resulting construct-level scores to the treated as continuous approximation interval data. This approach was supported by the study of \textcite{Huh2025}, which found that merging multiple Likert variables into a total score not only preserves the underlying correlation structures but also increases overall statistical power. 

The overall mean score for each construct was computed by taking the mean of the composite scores of all respondents, this is given by Equation \ref{Xbar},

\begin{equation}
	\label{Xbar}
	\bar{X} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m} X_i}{m}
\end{equation}

Where, $\bar{X}$ is the overall mean score for a given construct, $X_i$ is the composite score for the $i$-th respondent, and $m$ is the total number of respondents. The mean provided a summary measure of overall user acceptance (for TAM constructs) and overall system quality (for ISO/IEC 25010:2023 constructs). 

The sample standard deviation was also calculated to get the variability of response among the evaluators. A lower standard deviation indicates that the respondents were in strong agreement regarding Lakad's system acceptance and quality.  The formula for sample standard deviation is given by Equation \ref{S},

\begin{equation}
	\label{S}
	s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m} (X_i - \bar{X})^2}{m-1}}
\end{equation}

Where, $s$ is the sample standard deviation, $X_i$ is the composite score for the $i$-th respondent, $\bar{X}$ is the overall mean score for a given construct, and $m$ is the total number of respondents.

The interpretation of the mean scores for both TAM and ISO/IEC 25010:2023 was based on a predefined scale that categorizes the mean scores into descriptive ratings and interpretations. The interpretation tables for both TAM and ISO/IEC 25010:2023 are presented in Table \ref{inter:tam} and Table \ref{inter:iso}, respectively.

\section{Ethical Considerations}
Ethical considerations played a crucial role in the conduct of this study, especially since it involved the participation of real people, and government institutions and offices. The ethical guidelines were strictly followed in compliance with the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10173) and Bulacan State University’s (BulSU) College of Science (CS) Ethical Committee, to uphold the integrity of the research and to ensure the privacy and security of all collected data. Obtaining informed consent, implementing data encryption, and enforcing strict access controls were observed to safeguard the rights and confidentiality of all individuals and institutions involved in the evaluation and development of the system.


\subsection{Informed Consent}
Participants of the study were required to give informed consent before responding to any personally identifying data or opinions that were collected for the study, usability testing, and system evaluation. Consent materials informed respondents about the study purpose, what data would be collected, how the data would be used, risks and benefits, and contact details for further questions regarding the study. The project followed recognized Philippine guidance on ethical review and informed consent processes such as the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10173). Participants were also given the freedom to withdraw their responses at will, at which point the collected data from them would be discarded and deleted.

In addition to individual respondents, the study also involved data collection from government offices, particularly from the Bulacan Provincial History, Arts, Culture, and Tourism Office (PHACTO) and other related agencies that maintained official records on local attractions and tourism statistics. As per the request of the PHACTO, a letter required to be sent formally addressed the Provincial Governor and the Head of the Provincial Tourism Department to request permission to access relevant datasets or documents. These data included, but were not limited to, lists of Points of Interest (POIs), and visitor statistics of tourism establishments.

The request letters clearly outlined the purpose of the data use, the scope of the requested information, and the intended outcomes of the study. Only publicly shareable or officially permitted data were considered and were used in compliance with all terms set by the concerned government offices. The use of such data was limited strictly to academic and system development purposes.

\subsection{Confidentiality and Privacy}
All personal or sensitive information collected during the study remained confidential. Any identifiable data from participants or government records such as names or addresses were anonymized before analysis or publication by not digitizing said fields and replacing them with code or identifiers instead. Access to raw data was restricted to authorized research team members only, and all information was securely stored in digital repositories.


\subsection{Data Protection}
All collected data were processed and stored in compliance with the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10173) and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR). The principles of transparency and legitimate purpose in handling personal and institutional data were followed. Appropriate technical and organizational security measures, such as encrypted file storage and secure data transmission, were implemented to protect information from unauthorized access or loss. The collected physical data were safely compiled in one clear book folder which was stored inside a vault for the duration of the study and would be disposed of one month after the final defense, and digitally collected data were encrypted in a spreadsheet file only accessible by the researchers, and would be deleted one month after the final defense.


\subsection{Ethical Data Collection}
The data collection process was guided by integrity and accountability. Only information relevant to the objectives of the system was gathered. The collection of data did not include sensitive personal information unless necessary and, if in any case it was, it was collected under the permission of the respondent. In compliance with Philippine regulations, the consenting respondents that were considered for the survey were strictly 18 years old and above.

For survey and usability testing activities, participation was entirely voluntary, and responses were treated as confidential. For institutional data, such as those obtained from PHACTO or other local government offices, the researchers followed the formal request procedures and upheld any data-sharing agreements or confidentiality clauses that were imposed by the office.


\subsection{Transparency and Integrity}
The researchers maintained transparency throughout the conduct of the study. All research methods, procedures, data sources, and analytical processes were accurately documented and reported. The team strictly avoided misrepresentation of data, selective reporting of results, or exaggeration of the system’s capabilities.

Acknowledgment was given to all sources of information, including government offices and online databases. Conflicts of interest, if any, were disclosed openly. All representations made to data providers, research participants, and readers were honest and verifiable.

The study upheld the principles of academic integrity, guided by the ethical standards outlined by the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10173), Republic Act No. 8293 (Intellectual Property Code of the Philippines), and institutional research ethics guidelines of Bulacan State University (BulSU).
